    # desc: For the clients of The Adpharm, analytics drive sales. ADAPTS is a URL shortener that enables an omnichannel experience.
    desc:
      ADAPTS allows The Adpharm to get specific on which channels are converting
      and which arenâ€™t. This information is used to optimize the allocation of
      human and monetary resources, leading to compounded results on top
      performers and minified losses on the losers.
